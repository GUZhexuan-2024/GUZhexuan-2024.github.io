### Preface
The blogs are solely used to record my study of optimization methods and, as such, will not be as comprehensive or detailed as the referenced textbook,[Numerical Optimization][1]. Additionally, as a computer science major student, I aim to keep the content practical rather than abstract.

#### Main idea
Given a function $f$ and assume we are now at point $x_{k}$, since we want to minimize the function value, we aim to find a new point $x_{k+1}$, s.t., $f(x_{k+1}) < f(x_{k})$. But how to find this new point? Line search tells you to search along a direction $p_{k}$. Therefore, the iteration of line search is given by
$$
x_{k+1} = x_{k} + \alpha_{k}p_{k}.
$$
