My name is GU Zhexuan. I'm currently a PhD student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University supervised by Prof. [Yuan Yancheng][supervisor1] and Prof. [Huang Jian][supervisor2].

<!-- - I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
